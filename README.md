# Telephone Portable <sub><sup>_mini_</sup></sub>
If you're here god has already abandoned you. <sub>_Yes this is technically "mini" despite being bigger than Telephone Portable regular. I'll get arround to renaming the project... eventually._

## About
It's a glorified model viewer that can't load models. Please leave.

## Supported platforms
- Android
- WebGL
- The void
- """""iOS"""""

    _\*These are just the ones we release in releases. You can probably compile for more. Generally, mouse and touch are the only supported input methods._

## Rights
I own about 0.000% of the models in use. Do not download this if you do not want to break the law.
